# Context packet

version: 0.1 (draft, freezes Day 3)
Owner: Workstream B. This is the **only thing the LLM plane receives** besides the system prompt.

Context engineering is an explicit pipeline stage: select, compress, order and budget what the model sees, with provenance and permissions attached.

## Construction rules
1. **Only authorized evidence.** Every item passed the PDP just-in-time. Denied content never enters the packet.
2. **Per-source quotas** so one platform cannot crowd out the others; **deduplicate** near-identical chunks.
3. **Compress** to relevant snippets (extractive first), keeping provenance; never merge across documents.
4. **Order** evidence to avoid "lost in the middle" (strongest first and last).
5. **Token budget** enforced; drop lowest-ranked evidence first, never truncate mid-sentence.
6. **Spotlighting and sanitization:** wrap each snippet in delimiters; strip or neutralize instruction-like text; set `flags: ["possible_injection"]` and record it in the audit log. Retrieved text is data, never instructions.
7. **User context is built only from data the user may see** and is itself ACL-labeled. It may boost ranking and resolve references; it never filters out results the user may see, and never grants access.
8. **No secrets and no connector credentials** anywhere in the packet.

## Working memory
Conversation memory entries are labeled with the intersection of their sources' ACLs and re-checked on every turn; an entry whose source the user can no longer see is dropped.

## Quality metrics (evals)
Context precision and recall on the golden set, citation precision, abstention correctness, and token cost per answer.

## Changelog
